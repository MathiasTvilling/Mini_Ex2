For this week's mini exercise, exploring the notion of fun, I wanted to create a game. Games can be fun in many different ways: some may be frustratingly difficult, but give you a sense of accomplishment, which can be really fun. Some can be ridiculous and easy to laugh at. Some can be puzzling, creating an addiction to know more. Games, both in physical form and on the screen, absorbs you and lets you disappear into that world. To me, however, games are first and foremost entertainment, which is why I wanted to create a small game of my own. In the game, you are in control of a small rocket ship flying in space. The rocket is made from a GIF I found online and can only move across the x-axel using the left and right arrows on the keyboard. Underway, the rocket will encounter obstacles in the form of flying circles, which it is to dodge in order to keep flying. The game is called Rocket Man, named after the Elton John song, which plays on loop throughout the game. The game will go on forever, as the Rocket man will never reach his end destination - the only way to end the game, is to crash into a circle along the way. 
In relation to Goriunova's notion of fun, I thought of this as "fun and games", and in a sort of paradoxical manor, because the game obviously never (in principle) ends. The irony of the song playing in the background also supports this. 

Making a game turned out to be A LOT more difficult than I'd imagined before starting - and of course, while the game works, there is a lot of flaws in the code, that I was unable to solve. 
I imported a picture of stars to be used as the background of my game, and used createImg to import my GIF rocket. Moving the rocket was done by assigning it an initial x-value, and altering this with the use of the if function keyIsDown. I have used a lot of variables, even when it wasn't necessary, in order to learn more about how they work. This went fairly easily, however I was not able to limit the rocket to move only on the canvas. The rocket can go outside and far away from the picture I have used as background if the arrow keys are pressed for long enough. I imagine the problem can be solved by adding some parameters, but I have not been able to do that in this exact program before the deadline. The raining circles caused me a lot of problems. Originally, there was supposed to be three circles at a time at all times. As you can see in the code, I tried to make this happen, but for some reason more than one never appeared, and only distorted the one that did. Therefore, in order to make the game work, I settled with just the one. 
Ending the game proved difficult as well, and in order to make a long story short, I ending up resorting to crashing the game when a circle touches the rocket. The mySound.stop() function causes this, and I am still unaware as why - but this means that the text stays on screen, the music stops, and the rocket is unable to move, which were all problems before. I originally intended to make a restart button, but seeing as this did not work either, I settled on having to refresh the browser each time you lose.

This experience has taught me loads more than I could write here, but I also feel like I perhaps wanted a bit more than my current coding skills were capable of delivering. Never the less, I intend to return to this game later on in the semester, in order to see whether I have learnt something which could perfect it.
